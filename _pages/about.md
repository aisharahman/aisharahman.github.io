- I am a Ph.D. candidate in the <a href="https://ecee.engineering.asu.edu/" target="_blank">School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.asu.edu/" target="_blank">Arizona State University</a>, continuing my research and academic journey after transferring from the <a href="https://www.unm.edu/" target="_blank">University of New Mexico </a>. I am a graduate student member of IEEE, former Chair of <a href="https://r6.ieee.org/albuquerque-wie/" target="_blank">IEEE Albuquerque Women in Engineering Affinity group</a>, former Vice-Chair of IEEE Albuquerque Computer Society and Communications Society Joint Chapter.
- I am currently a member of <a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/eirini-eleni-tsiropoulou/home" target="_blank">PROTON lab </a> and working as a research assistant in two DOE-funded projects in collaboration with Sandia National Laboratories and National Renewable Energy Laboratory, HELIOCOMM: A Resilient Wireless Heliostats Communication System and Goaltender: Cloud-Based Defense and Response Tools for the DER Ecosystem.
- My major research focuses on developing distributed decision-making policies for heterogeneous networks, including Wireless Networks,  Sustainable Computing systems, Federated Learning systems, Online Social Networks (OSNs), Distributed Energy Resources ecosystem, etc.
- I interned at Idaho National Laboratory during the summer of 2025. I worked within the Vehicle-Grid Integration team at the Advanced Transportation Department. I developed a decentralized decision-making framework for electric vehicles (EV) to provide black-starting ancillary service during grid outages, across varying EV availability, battery capacities, and energy exchange rates.
- As a Woman in Technology, I have been awarded the Cadence Diversity in Technology Scholarship 2022. I have also been awarded the IEEE Outstanding Service Award 2023 as a recognition for my service as the Chair of <a href="https://r6.ieee.org/albuquerque-wie/" target="_blank">IEEE Women in Engineering Affinity Group Albuquerque Section</a>. In 2024, I was selected as the IEEE Outstanding Graduate Student by IEEE Albuquerque Section.
